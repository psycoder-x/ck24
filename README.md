# The CK Programming Language (2024)

This repository contains the definition of the CK programming language in 2024, also known as CK24.
Please read the latest release available.

The definition is written in these languages:

 * English

 * Ukrainian

## Releases

There are three types of release:

 * LTS (Long-Term Support) - a release that contains the definition of CK24.
 There is only one such release.
 The best release to follow.
 Because the definition that was released as LTS is made to be forever.
 
 * RLS (Release) - a release that contains the definition of CK24 but may be incomplete.
 Little can change in the future. Each RLS is an LTS release candidate.
 
 * DFT (Draft) - a release that contains an incomplete definition.
 A lot can change in the future.

## Implementation

[CKC](https://github.com/psycoder-x/ckc) is an official implementation of the CK programming language.
CKC is a compiler that fully conforms to the definition.

Anyone can create an implementation of the CK programming language that fully or partially
conforms to one of the released definitions.

Please don't deceive people.
If your implementation doesn't fully match the original definition, let the user know.
